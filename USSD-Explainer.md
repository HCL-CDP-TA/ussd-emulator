# Understanding Telecom Marketing & USSD in Markets with Limited Internet Penetration

---

## 1. The Market & Customer Context

In many parts of the world—Africa, Asia, Latin America, and rural or low-income communities—large segments of the population either have basic (“feature”) mobile phones or do not have reliable or affordable mobile Internet/data access. These customers:

- May not own smartphones or have expensive data plans.
- May have intermittent or slow connectivity.
- Are very familiar with simple text / menu-driven interfaces.

Telecom operators in such markets often rely heavily on **prepaid** services, frequent top-ups, bundles (for voice, SMS, data), and value-added services (VAS) to generate revenue. The path to purchase is more frequent, smaller transactions rather than large monthly postpaid bills.

## 2. What is USSD & Why It’s Important

**USSD = Unstructured Supplementary Service Data**. It’s a protocol built into GSM networks that allows a mobile phone user to initiate a session by dialing a short code (e.g. \*123#), to interact with a menu or application on the network.

### Characteristics of USSD

| Feature                         | Description                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Session-based, interactive**  | Users navigate menus in real time; two-way interaction happens immediately.                                          |
| **No Internet / Data required** | Works over GSM signaling, so even phones without data plans can use USSD.                                            |
| **Works on all phones**         | Includes basic feature phones; phones don’t need to install anything.                                                |
| **Fast responses**              | Because sessions remain open and responses are immediate, compared to SMS which can be store-and-forward or delayed. |

**Common uses of USSD**:

- Checking balances (airtime/data)
- Purchasing top-ups or bundles
- Banking / mobile money services
- Value-added services: surveys, competitions, offers, vouchers

## 3. How Marketing / Promotion Works in These Markets

Marketing in USSD-heavy or low-internet markets works differently from app/web/data-centric markets.

### Key Attributes

- **High reach via basic phones**: USSD works without smartphones or data.
- **Frequent, bite-sized interactions**: Customers are used to topping up often or buying small bundles.
- **Simple menu-based navigation & options**: Offers delivered via menu of choices.
- **Low friction; minimal steps**: Every extra step reduces conversion.

### Typical Marketing Channels & Campaign Types

| Campaign Type                    | Example / Use Case                                      |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Promotional Bundles / Offers** | “Dial \*123# to see today’s special data bundle offer.” |
| **Vouchers & Coupons**           | “Redeem code via USSD for free SMS/data.”               |
| **Surveys / Feedback**           | Collect customer opinions via USSD menus.               |
| **Contests & Competitions**      | Entry via USSD codes; supported by SMS reminders.       |
| **Reminder Services**            | Features like “Please Call Me” or low-balance prompts.  |

**Drivers of Conversion**

- Timely & relevant offers
- Simplicity and speed
- Clear pricing and trust
- Multichannel reinforcement (SMS, call, retail agent)

## 4. USSD vs Digital / App-Heavy Markets

| Aspect                     | Developed Markets (Web/App/Data-centric)                   | USSD / Mixed Markets                            |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Access Channel** | Apps, responsive websites, high-speed data                 | USSD, SMS, feature phones                       |
| **User Interface & UX**    | Rich visuals, images, video, interactive content           | Text menus, simple choices, direct prompts      |
| **Types of Offers**        | Complex bundles, multimedia, free trials, in-app purchases | Mini bundles, top-ups, vouchers, balance alerts |
| **Speed of Interaction**   | Customer can browse multiple screens, slower decisions     | Real-time decisions, immediate selection        |
| **Reach & Inclusion**      | Skips non-smartphone users                                 | Almost universal for mobile users               |

## 5. How USSD Sessions Are Initiated

USSD sessions **must be started by the customer**. The network cannot push a USSD menu directly to the phone.

- Typically, the telecom sends an **SMS call-to-action**:
  > “You’re low on data! Check today’s special bundles: dial \*123#.”
- The customer **dials the code** to start the session.
- A **menu appears**, for example:
  1. Buy 1 GB data
  2. Buy 5 GB data
  3. Upgrade plan
  4. Exit
- The customer selects an option → the transaction executes immediately → confirmation is shown via USSD or SMS.

This approach combines **proactive marketing via SMS** with **interactive, session-based USSD menus**, while still being accessible to all phones.

## 6. Coverage Considerations (2G/3G/4G/5G)

The type of network coverage directly impacts how customers can engage with telecom services and marketing:

- **USSD works on all networks**: 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G. Even basic phones with only 2G can use USSD reliably.
- **Data-heavy apps or websites require 3G/4G/5G**: Users in areas with only 2G or poor coverage may experience slow or failed app interactions.
- **Marketing strategy adapts to coverage**:
  - 2G/3G areas → simple, text-based interactions (USSD/SMS) dominate.
  - 4G/5G areas → app, web, and richer digital experiences become feasible.
- **Hybrid approach**: Even in high-speed areas, USSD ensures universal reach for prepaid or lower-income users.

---

## 7. Why USSD Remains Relevant

- Works in low-connectivity areas and with basic phones.
- No data cost; no app download required.
- Pre-existing infrastructure and regulated short codes.
- Familiarity: many customers know the codes from long-standing use.

**Best use cases**:

- Prepaid customers topping up frequently
- Rural or lower income segments
- Customers without reliable access to data/smartphones

---

## 8. Challenges & Considerations

- Limited branding/UX (bare text, minimal visuals)
- Menu fatigue if too many steps
- Security & trust concerns (risk of scams)
- Cost & regulatory considerations for session handling
- Accessing real-time data for personalised offers can be difficult

---

## 9. Typical Marketing Flow Using USSD

1. **Trigger**: e.g., low balance, nearing plan expiry.
2. **Customer Prompt**: SMS alert: “Dial \*XYZ# to see today’s offer.”
3. **USSD Menu**: Customer chooses from options: top up, upgrade, redeem voucher, exit.
4. **Selection**: Customer chooses an offer tailored to their profile.
5. **Confirmation**: Purchase or upgrade completed; confirmation via USSD/SMS.
6. **Follow-up**: SMS reminders or agent calls if no action taken.

## 10. Why Marketers Should Understand This

- Large portions of customers may only be reachable via USSD/SMS.
- Effective marketing requires offers to be fast, simple, and relevant.
- Hybrid models (USSD + app/web) are emerging; mastery of both increases competitive advantage.
